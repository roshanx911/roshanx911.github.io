CHANGE 006
This article base on analysis of Software Life Cycle (SLC) & Software Process Models (SPM) and why we need to follow-through these in development process. Part-06 focus on Spiral Model. <!--more-->

#### The Spiral Model

The spiral model, suggested by B. Boehm in 1988, recognizes that the waterfall model is not a realistic representation, nor is it necessarily a healthy one. Instead, the spiral model augments the waterfall model with a series of strategic prototyping and risk assessment activities throughout the life cycle. The image of the model is a spiral that starts in the middle and continually revisits the basic tasks of customer communication, planning, risk analysis, engineering, construction and release, and customer evaluation.

The spiral model is depicted in above. Starting at the center of the figure, the product life cycle continues in a spiral path from the concept and requirements phases. Prototyping and risk analysis are used along the way to evaluate the feasibility of potential features. More prototyping is used after a software development plan is written, and again after the design and tests have been developed. After that, the model behaves somewhat like a waterfall model.
