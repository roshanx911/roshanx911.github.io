#### Applying Project Management Strategies to Development

“Project management consists of the knowledge, skills, methods, techniques, and tools used to plan and manage project work. It establishes a sound basis for effective planning, scheduling, resourcing, decision making, management, and plan revision. Project management skills help complete projects on schedule, within budget, and in full accordance with project specifications. At the same time, they help achieve the other goals of the organization, such as productivity, quality, and cost-effectiveness. The objective of project management is to ensure that projects meet agreed goals of time, cost, and scope.” (Richman, 2011)

#### Main Components that Define in Project

A project is a temporary undertaking performed to produce a unique product, service, or result. Project has the following three components:
- “Specific Scope: Desired results or products
- Schedule: Established dates when project work starts and ends
- Required Resources: Necessary amounts of man power, funds, and other resources”

The Basis of a Project’s Definition for the Following Three Reasons:
- “The only reason a project exists is to produce the results specified in its scope.
- The project‘s end date is an essential part of defining what constitutes successful performance. -> The desired result must be provided by a certain time to meet its intended need.
- The availability of resources shapes the nature of the products the project can produce.”
(Portny, 2010)
