### Applying Project Management Strategies to Development of Web Application

“Project management consists of the knowledge, skills, methods, techniques, and tools used to plan and manage project work. It establishes a sound basis for effective planning, scheduling, resourcing, decision making, management, and plan revision. Project management skills help complete projects on schedule, within budget, and in full accordance with project specifications. At the same time, they help achieve the other goals of the organization, such as productivity, quality, and cost-effectiveness. The objective of project management is to ensure that projects meet agreed goals of time, cost, and scope.” (Richman, 2011)
