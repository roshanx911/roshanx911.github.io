This article base on analysis of Software Life Cycle (SLC) & Software Process Models (SPM) and why we need to follow-through these in development process. Part-02 focus on SDLC in general. <!--more--> 

#### Software Life Cycle & Activities

“The software life cycle is the sequence of different activities that take place during software development. There are also different deliverables produced. Although deliverables can be agreements or evaluations, normally deliverables are objects, such as source code or user manuals. Usually, the activities and deliverables are closely related. Milestones are events that can be used for telling the status of the project. For management purposes, milestones are essential because completion of milestones allow assess the progress of the software development.” 

(Gustafson, 2002)

#### Analysis of Software Life Cycle (SLC) & Software Process Models (SPM)

The software life cycle is the sequence of different activities that take place during software development.
A software process model is a simplified representation of a software process. Each process model represents a process from a particular perspective, and thus provides only partial information about that process.

Different Phases of software life cycle models available, by considering its functionalities of SPM & project scope deliverables decisions need to be made. These are the considered different, most common software process models:

> [The Linear Sequential Model][Part-1]
> 
> [The Prototyping Model][Part-2]
> 
> [The Incremental Model][Part-3]
> 
> [The Spiral Model][Part-4]
> 
> [The Evolutionary / RAD Models][Part-5]
