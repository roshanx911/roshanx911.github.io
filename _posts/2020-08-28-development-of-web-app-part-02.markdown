This article base on analysis of Software Life Cycle (SLC) & Software Process Models (SPM) and why we need to follow-through these in development process. <!--more-->

#### Software Life Cycle & Activities

“The software life cycle is the sequence of different activities that take place during software development. There are also different deliverables produced. Although deliverables can be agreements or evaluations, normally deliverables are objects, such as source code or user manuals. Usually, the activities and deliverables are closely related. Milestones are events that can be used for telling the status of the project. For management purposes, milestones are essential because completion of milestones allow assess the progress of the software development.” 

(Gustafson, 2002)
